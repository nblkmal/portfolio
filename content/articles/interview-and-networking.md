## :electric_plug: __How Networking relates with Interviews__
### 💬 __1. Networking comes first__

Networking is the foundation that leads to interview opportunities.
It’s what helps you get noticed before your résumé even reaches HR.

Why networking comes first:

Most jobs (especially in tech) are filled through referrals or connections, not just job boards.

A strong network gives you warm introductions, which carry more trust.

When someone in the company says, “Hey, I know this person, they’d fit well here,” you skip to the front of the line.

Networking helps you understand company culture and expectations, so when the interview comes, you’re more prepared and aligned.

> My first job came from a casual chat with friends during a short getaway. I slipped my name to be one of the candidates for interviews.

> I gained most of my experiences from my network, as in side projects, freelance gigs, and collaborations.

### 🎙️ __2. The Interview is an Extension of Networking__

Think of the interview as networking in a formal setting, it’s your chance to deepen the professional relationship you started.

How they connect:

Networking builds awareness of who you are.

The interview tests fit, both technical and personal.

Even if you don’t get hired, you’ve built a long-term connection with the company or interviewer.

Many interviewers remember good candidates and reach out later when new roles open up.

> For any interview that did not go well, I put it in the my future reference.

### 🔄 __3. Networking → Interview → Networking Again__

It’s a cycle, not a one-time sequence.

Networking gets you noticed.

Interview turns attention into opportunity.

Post-interview networking keeps the door open, thank-you messages, updates on your projects, or meeting again at industry events.

Each stage feeds the next.

> In case of failure, treat it as a networking opportunity, ask for feedback, express continued interest, and stay connected.

## :white_check_mark: __Connect with the Right People__
> Connecting with the right people isn’t about chasing famous names, it’s about surrounding yourself with people who inspire you to level up

- __Quality over quantity__, it’s not about collecting contacts; it’s about building meaningful relationships with people who share your interests or values.
- __Start with proximity__, connect with seniors, lecturers, alumni, or professionals from your university’s network; they’re most likely to respond.
- __Target relevance__, focus on people in roles, companies, or industries you want to learn from.
- __Engage genuinely__, comment thoughtfully on their posts, share insights, or ask follow-up questions instead of cold-pitching.
- __Give before you ask__, share something useful, offer feedback, or show appreciation for their work before requesting advice or referrals.
- __Be clear in your approach__, when you reach out, state who you are, what you’re studying/doing, and why you admire their work.
- __Use multiple channels__, LinkedIn, tech meetups, conferences, hackathons, open-source communities.
- __Leverage shared interests__, common tech stacks, local events, or mutual contacts make conversations more natural.
- __Follow up__, send a short thank-you message after a chat, or update them when you’ve applied their advice.
- __Stay visible__, regularly share your learning, side projects, or reflections, people remember those who show consistent growth.

> Connecting in social media is not the same as having a real connection. Go out and meet people in real life when possible. It is a chain of reactions! :link:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: __Build Yourself__
> Before you can connect with the right people or impress in interviews, you need to have something real to show such as skills, attitude, and growth. Your personal brand is built before the opportunity comes.

- __Invest in your skills first__, people and opportunities gravitate toward those who consistently learn and build things.
- __Show your work publicly__, share small projects, experiments, or reflections online; this attracts like-minded people and future interviewers.
- __Be intentional with your learning__, focus on topics that align with your career goals and the people you want to connect with.
- __Document your journey__, turn what you learn into content (LinkedIn post, GitHub repo, short blog). It makes networking effortless, people find you.
- __Build credibility__, not just confidence, it’s easier to network when you have proof of effort or results to talk about.
- __Let curiosity lead__, genuine curiosity makes you memorable in both networking and interviews.
- __Adopt a growth mindset__, treat rejections, slow progress, or awkward conversations as part of your growth story.
- __Stay consistent__, growth and reputation compound; people notice reliability over time.
- __Reflect on feedback__, every conversation, rejection, or mentor advice is input for self-improvement.
- __Be the person others want to recommend__, respectful, reliable, and continuously improving.

> “Don’t wait to be discovered, start building yourself so when opportunity knocks, you’re already ready.”
