## :electric_plug: __How Networking relates with Interviews__
### 💬 __1. Networking comes first__

Networking is the foundation that leads to interview opportunities.
It’s what helps you get noticed before your résumé even reaches HR.

Why networking comes first:

Most jobs (especially in tech) are filled through referrals or connections, not just job boards.

A strong network gives you warm introductions, which carry more trust.

When someone in the company says, “Hey, I know this person, they’d fit well here,” you skip to the front of the line.

Networking helps you understand company culture and expectations, so when the interview comes, you’re more prepared and aligned.

> “When I was starting out, one of my interviews happened because I regularly shared my coding experiments on LinkedIn. A senior dev saw my posts and referred me. My first impression was already made before I entered the interview.”

### 🎙️ __2. The Interview is an Extension of Networking__

Think of the interview as networking in a formal setting, it’s your chance to deepen the professional relationship you started.

How they connect:

Networking builds awareness of who you are.

The interview tests fit, both technical and personal.

Even if you don’t get hired, you’ve built a long-term connection with the company or interviewer.

Many interviewers remember good candidates and reach out later when new roles open up.

> I’ve kept in touch with candidates who didn’t pass initially but showed great attitude and curiosity. Months later, we hired one when a new position opened.

### 🔄 __3. Networking → Interview → Networking Again__

It’s a cycle, not a one-time sequence.

Networking gets you noticed.

Interview turns attention into opportunity.

Post-interview networking keeps the door open, thank-you messages, updates on your projects, or meeting again at industry events.

Each stage feeds the next.

> In case of failure, treat it as a networking opportunity, ask for feedback, express continued interest, and stay connected.

## :white_check_mark: __Connect with the Right People__
> Connecting with the right people isn’t about chasing famous names, it’s about surrounding yourself with people who inspire you to level up

- Quality over quantity, it’s not about collecting contacts; it’s about building meaningful relationships with people who share your interests or values.
- Start with proximity, connect with seniors, lecturers, alumni, or professionals from your university’s network; they’re most likely to respond.
- Target relevance, focus on people in roles, companies, or industries you want to learn from.
- Engage genuinely, comment thoughtfully on their posts, share insights, or ask follow-up questions instead of cold-pitching.
- Give before you ask, share something useful, offer feedback, or show appreciation for their work before requesting advice or referrals.
- Be clear in your approach, when you reach out, state who you are, what you’re studying/doing, and why you admire their work.
- Use multiple channels, LinkedIn, tech meetups, conferences, hackathons, open-source communities.
- Leverage shared interests, common tech stacks, local events, or mutual contacts make conversations more natural.
- Follow up, send a short thank-you message after a chat, or update them when you’ve applied their advice.
- Stay visible, regularly share your learning, side projects, or reflections, people remember those who show consistent growth.

> Connecting in social media is not the same as having a real connection. Go out and meet people in real life when possible. It is a chain of reactions! :link:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: __Build Yourself__
> Before you can connect with the right people or impress in interviews, you need to have something real to show such as skills, attitude, and growth. Your personal brand is built before the opportunity comes.

- Invest in your skills first, people and opportunities gravitate toward those who consistently learn and build things.
- Show your work publicly, share small projects, experiments, or reflections online; this attracts like-minded people and future interviewers.
- Be intentional with your learning, focus on topics that align with your career goals and the people you want to connect with.
- Document your journey, turn what you learn into content (LinkedIn post, GitHub repo, short blog). It makes networking effortless, people find you.
- Build credibility, not just confidence, it’s easier to network when you have proof of effort or results to talk about.
- Let curiosity lead, genuine curiosity makes you memorable in both networking and interviews.
- Adopt a growth mindset, treat rejections, slow progress, or awkward conversations as part of your growth story.
- Stay consistent, growth and reputation compound; people notice reliability over time.
- Reflect on feedback, every conversation, rejection, or mentor advice is input for self-improvement.
- Be the person others want to recommend, respectful, reliable, and continuously improving.

> “Don’t wait to be discovered, start building yourself so when opportunity knocks, you’re already ready.”
